TC: O(w*b)
SP: O(w*b)
First calculate manhattan distance for all worker/bike combination and store it in hmap, maintain two variables to keep track of min/max distances
Iterate through the min/max range and start assiging bikes to workers by keeping track of the assigned unassigned bikes and unassigned workers.
